Many drivers decided to break their leases. \n\nIn Nanning City, Guangxi Province, taxi drivers lined up in front of the auto rental company. Police officers were also present. There were so many taxis that you couldn’t even see where the line ends.\n-\nA man said:\n “There are too many taxis. Drivers just want to return the cars. But the company owner would not come out. Look at the many taxis. Can you see where it ends? The parking lot is full. Police are also here.”\nRearrange version: \nTake a look how long the car line is and you can’t see where it ends.\nThe company would’t let the cars enter the lot.\nPolice are also here.\nThe parking lot is full.\nWe just want to return the cars.\nThe company owner would not come out.\n-\nThe following video was shot In Jinan City, Shandong Province. \nMany taxis parked outside the auto rental company. It was said that these drivers were hoping to negotiate their monthly fees.\nDuring the pandemic, Chinese taxi drivers suffer from lack of passengers and persisting monthly charges from auto rental companies. Videos on social media show taxi driver protests taking place in China.\n#CCPvirus #Wuhan #Coronavirus\n\nSign the Petition to Investigate, Condemn, and Reject the Chinese Communist Party\n▶️https://ccpvirustruth.com\n\n------------------\nSUBSCRIBE OUR CHANNEL TODAY: \n🔔https://bit.ly/EpochSubs\n\nFollow us on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/epochtimes/\n\nWATCH MORE ON YOUTUBE\n🔵 [Exclusive investigative report] The first documentary movie on the origin of C.C.P. virus\n👉 https://bit.ly/OriginOfVirus\n\n🔵Doctors and Nurses Dismissed, Some Having Fought the Pandemic on the Frontlines\n👉 https://bit.ly/3fqXgaI\n\n🔵 Police Clash with Garment Makers and Store Owners Asking for Rent Reduction in Guangzhou Market\n👉 https://bit.ly/2YONR7l\n\n------------------\nGet the latest updates as well as exclusive reporting and first-hand videos about the CCP virus from The Epoch Times website.\n▶️ https://www.theepochtimes.com/coronavirus\n------------------\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE EPOCH TIMES\nPrint subscription (delivery inside the U.S only):\nhttps://theepochtimes.f2vr2q.net/q9Bob"
